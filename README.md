# DeliverEase

DeliverEase is a mobile-first, cloud-based application built to simplify the food delivery experience. It helps users compare multiple food delivery services—Grubhub, DoorDash, and UberEATS—in real time, offering side-by-side insights into wait times, costs, deals, and more. This README outlines the project's purpose, development process, tools used, and how success was measured.

## 🧠 Business Case

The rise of food delivery platforms has created a fragmented user experience. Customers must juggle multiple apps to find the best deal, wasting time and often overpaying. DeliverEase solves this by serving as a single interface to compare prices, delivery time, and availability across platforms. It empowers users to make informed decisions quickly and easily.

Jake and Elwood Blues, the project initiators, wanted a non-technical solution to a widespread technical problem. The goal was to deliver a seamless, intuitive tool that hides complexity behind user-friendly design and functionality.

## 🎯 End Goal

To develop a responsive mobile application that integrates with major food delivery APIs and provides:
- Price and time comparisons for multiple delivery platforms.
- Fuzzy search capabilities for flexible user queries.
- A clean, accessible, and easy-to-use interface.
- Seamless hand-off to the selected delivery app with the user's selected cart items.

The system is designed to support growth, enabling integration with additional platforms in future releases.

## 📘 Case Study Summary

**Product Name:** DeliverEase  
**Vision:** To reduce frustration for food delivery customers by offering a smarter, unified interface for making ordering decisions.

**Big Picture:**
Users log into the app and search for a specific dish or restaurant. DeliverEase uses fuzzy logic to retrieve close matches from connected platforms. A comparison list shows price, estimated delivery time, and deals. After selecting an item, the cart transfers to the selected app for order completion. The user never shares financial data with DeliverEase.

**Revenue Model:**
- Free with ads or $1.99/year for an ad-free experience
- Selling anonymized order data to third parties for research and analytics

**Target Group:**
- College students and young professionals using food delivery services multiple times a week

**Main Features:**
- Real-time delivery comparison from Grubhub, DoorDash, and UberEATS
- Smart fuzzy search for flexible food matching
- API-driven cart handoff to native delivery apps
- Secure login with no financial data storage

**Future Expansion:**
In Phase 2, support will expand to include Postmates, Instacart, Gopuff, ChowNow, and AggieFood.com. Each will follow the same integration model using user-provided credentials and API-based data retrieval.
